In this section,I will be setting up the iptables firewall using two virtual servers on azure.

- Lab 1
  - Created 2 servers with Ubuntu-server 24.04 and edited the network security group on Azure, this way the 2 servers can be able to ping each other and then restrict the ICMP trafic stablishing rules 
    at the INPUT chain on server1.
